-- Step 1: Create the Sales table
CREATE TABLE Sales (
    SalesID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Product VARCHAR(50),
    Region VARCHAR(50),
    Salesperson VARCHAR(50),
    Year INT,
    SalesAmount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Step 2: Insert sample data into the Sales table
INSERT INTO Sales (SalesID, Product, Region, Salesperson, Year, SalesAmount) VALUES
(1, 'Laptop', 'North', 'John', 2023, 1000),
(2, 'Laptop', 'South', 'Doe', 2023, 1200),
(3, 'Phone', 'North', 'Alice', 2023, 700),
(4, 'Tablet', 'West', 'Bob', 2023, 600),
(5, 'Laptop', 'North', 'John', 2024, 1100),
(6, 'Phone', 'East', 'Charlie', 2024, 900),
(7, 'Tablet', 'West', 'Doe', 2024, 650),
(8, 'Laptop', 'South', 'Alice', 2024, 1300),
(9, 'Phone', 'East', 'Charlie', 2023, 800),
(10, 'Tablet', 'North', 'Bob', 2024, 950);

-- Step 3: Apply OLAP Operations

-- a. ROLLUP: Aggregating by Product, Region, and Year
SELECT Product, Region, Year, SUM(SalesAmount) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY ROLLUP (Product, Region, Year);

-- b. CUBE: Aggregating by all combinations of Product, Region, and Year
SELECT Product, Region, Year, SUM(SalesAmount) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY CUBE (Product, Region, Year);

-- c. DRILL-DOWN: Drill down to specific details for Year 2023
SELECT Product, Region, Year, Salesperson, SUM(SalesAmount) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales
WHERE Year = 2023
GROUP BY Product, Region, Salesperson, Year;

-- d. SLICE: Filtering for 'Laptop' sales in 'North' region in 2023
SELECT Product, Region, Year, Salesperson, SalesAmount
FROM Sales
WHERE Product = 'Laptop' AND Region = 'North' AND Year = 2023;

-- e. DICE: Filtering for 'Laptop' and 'Phone' sales in 2024 across all regions
SELECT Product, Region, Year, SUM(SalesAmount) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales
WHERE Product IN ('Laptop', 'Phone') AND Year = 2024
GROUP BY Product, Region, Year;


-- basic OLAP operation (for diagram refer : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/olap-operations-in-dbms/

-- Drill down: In drill-down operation, the less detailed data is converted into highly detailed data. It can be done by:
-- Moving down in the concept hierarchy
-- Adding a new dimension
-- In the cube given in overview section, the drill down operation is performed by moving down in the concept hierarchy of Time dimension (Quarter -> Month).


-- Roll up: It is just opposite of the drill-down operation. It performs aggregation on the OLAP cube. It can be done by:
-- Climbing up in the concept hierarchy
-- Reducing the dimensions
-- In the cube given in the overview section, the roll-up operation is performed by climbing up in the concept hierarchy of Location dimension (City -> Country).


-- Dice: It selects a sub-cube from the OLAP cube by selecting two or more dimensions. In the cube given in the overview section, a sub-cube is selected by selecting following dimensions with criteria:
-- Location = “Delhi” or “Kolkata”
-- Time = “Q1” or “Q2”
-- Item = “Car” or “Bus”


-- Slice: It selects a single dimension from the OLAP cube which results in a new sub-cube creation. In the cube given in the overview section, Slice is performed on the dimension Time = “Q1”.
